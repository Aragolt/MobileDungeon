# Mobile Dungeon

Mobile Dungeon is looking to create a mobile game with dungeon crawler and MMO elements. The game uses Unity as a framework and is primarily written in C#. Key features include the use of an on screen joystick or dpad, auto attack player abilities, and the use of checkpoints throughout the game. One goal is for the user to be able to jump right back into the game right where they left off to continue progressing through the game.
